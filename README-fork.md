_To create a README for your sample_

1. _Copy this file to your sample folder._
1. _Enter the requested information below._
1. _Delete all intructions._

_For API samples use the name of the API. For example, a sample about the `chrome.declarativeNetRequest` would simply be called "chrome.declarativeNetRequest". (Do not use special formatting in headings.) For functional samples, the title should be what the sample demonstrates_

# Bookmark Sync with Notion

This sample will hopefully demonstrate an interface to wrangle your bookmarks and selectively upload them into a 3rd party tool like a Notion page. Ideally it'll also work the other way around and will download the content from the Notion page and have it loaded in a Chrome Bookmark folder ready to use. Based on and inspired from [chrome extensions' bookmark functional samples](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/chrome-extensions-samples/tree/main/functional-samples/sample.bookmarks). 
If other people already have code snippets for it, feel free to contribute!

## Overview

_Describe how the sample demonstrates the API or use case and briefly describe how to use it._
